# Subskills

This document defines the agent-factory subskills, their boundaries, and selection rules.
Each subskill is a self-contained procedure loaded by a subagent when assigned work.

## Subskill Reference

| Subskill      | Use For                                                                                   | Load                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `install`     | Installing agent-factory in a repository and creating required bindings/scaffolding       | [../procedures/install.md](../procedures/install.md)         |
| `plan`        | Creating, splitting, sequencing, clarifying, or cleaning up tracker work                  | [../procedures/plan.md](../procedures/plan.md)               |
| `orchestrate` | Running an epic or multi-item workstream and assigning subagents                          | [../procedures/orchestrate.md](../procedures/orchestrate.md) |
| `implement`   | Executing one ordinary assigned tracker item or owned slice                               | [../procedures/implement.md](../procedures/implement.md)     |
| `migrate`     | Demolition, reconnect, terminal validation, or other intentional temporary breakage       | [../procedures/migrate.md](../procedures/migrate.md)         |
| `review`      | Adversarial diff, code, design, architecture, security, or test-quality review            | [../procedures/review.md](../procedures/review.md)           |
| `validate`    | Scenario-centered product, operator, browser, runtime, integration, or preservation proof | [../procedures/validate.md](../procedures/validate.md)       |
| `docs`        | Documentation refresh, reconciliation, or docs/process drift cleanup                      | [../procedures/docs.md](../procedures/docs.md)               |
| `audit`       | Evidence-backed architecture-quality findings without implementing fixes                  | [../procedures/audit.md](../procedures/audit.md)             |
| `readiness`   | Assessing whether a repository is legible and operable by agents                          | [../procedures/readiness.md](../procedures/readiness.md)     |
| `tracker`     | Bound tracker abstraction, command routing, item standards, dependencies, and sync/check  | [tracker.md](tracker.md)                                     |

## Selection Rules

1. If the first argument is a subskill, load that subskill reference and follow it.
2. If no subskill is named and none of the rules below clearly applies, stop
   and ask for the assigned subskill.
3. If the work is an epic or spans multiple tracker items, use `orchestrate`; the orchestrator may then assign subagents to other subskills.
4. If the work starts from a diff, use `review`. If it starts from a scenario or behavior claim, use `validate`.
5. If `AGENTS.md` is missing or the user asks to set up agent-factory, use `install`.
6. If a tracker item intentionally permits breakage, closes out a migration, or asks for demolition/reconnect classification, use `migrate`.

## Boundary Conditions

### Do not use `implement` for

- Graph planning or tracker item management (use `plan`).
- Demolition, breaking migration, or terminal validation work (use `migrate`).
- Independent validation or read-only review (use `validate` or `review`).

### Do not use `plan` for

- Implementation of a named code item (use `implement`).
- Reshaping the graph while implementing unless explicitly assigned planning work.

### Do not use `validate` for

- Code review or diff analysis (use `review`).
- Fixing defects unless the tracker item explicitly assigns implementation work.

### Do not use `review` for

- Scenario-centered behavior proof (use `validate`).
- Closing product validation unless separately assigned the `validate` subskill.

### Do not use `migrate` for

- Ordinary implementation items without named temporary breakage (use `implement`).

### Do not use `audit` for

- Architecture-quality fixes (use `implement` or `migrate` after a tracker item describes the work).

### Do not use `readiness` for

- Architecture quality findings (use `audit`).
- Code review (use `review`).
- Behavior validation (use `validate`).
- CI/CD pipelines, PR workflows, or observability systems (out of scope).
