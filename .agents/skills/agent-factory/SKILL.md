# Agent Factory

Agent Factory assigns subskills for coordinated work from durable repository
state.

## General Guidelines

- Use the repository instructions to locate repo-specific docs, tracker state,
  validation guidance, and product conventions.
- For delegated work, the orchestrator explicitly assigns one subskill to each
  subagent. A subagent loads only the assigned subskill reference unless the
  assignment says otherwise.
- Spawn role-specific subagents with explicit task context: repository path,
  mission workspace, branch lifecycle context, assigned subskill, tracker item
  or mission identifiers, relevant files, and required validation. Include
  expected proof, evidence destination, and whether independent review or
  validation is required at issue, epic, or mission scope. Do not use
  fork-context for role-specific subagents.
- Use the repository's tracker. For Atelier, select executable issues from the
  active mission or epic graph unless doing planning or triage. See
  [standards/tracker.md](standards/tracker.md) for tracker workflow guidance.
- Write missions, epics, issues, validation items, and follow-up work using
  [standards/work-item-authoring.md](standards/work-item-authoring.md):
  describe the desired world and expected proof without scripting the
  implementation path.
- Use the proof rule from
  [standards/work-item-authoring.md](standards/work-item-authoring.md):
  ordinary work closes with proof on the issue, while risky, broad,
  public-contract, process-policy, parent-level, epic, and mission claims need
  first-class evidence and independent validation or review where appropriate.
- [standards/repo-workflow.md](standards/repo-workflow.md): git/worktree start, checkpoint, and handoff.
- Planning and execution are separate concerns. Do not reshape tracker scope
  while implementing unless graph management is the assigned subskill.
- High-leverage choices must be resolved before dependent implementation. If the
  outcome must be durable, create an artifact-update task.
- Use the mapped repo docs for code, architecture, validation, product, and
  quality rules.

| `orchestrate` | Run a mission/epic/workstream | [procedures/orchestrate.md](procedures/orchestrate.md) |
| `implement` | Execute one assigned slice | [procedures/implement.md](procedures/implement.md) |
| `migrate` | Demolition, reconnect, terminal validation, temporary breakage | [procedures/migrate.md](procedures/migrate.md) |

| `audit` | Evidence-backed architecture findings | [procedures/audit.md](procedures/audit.md) |
| `readiness` | Agent operability assessment | [procedures/readiness.md](procedures/readiness.md) |
| `tracker` | Tracker commands and item standards | [standards/tracker.md](standards/tracker.md) |

## Subskill Rules

1. If the first argument is a subskill, load that subskill reference and follow it.
2. If no subskill is named and none of the rules below clearly applies, stop
   and ask for the assigned subskill.
3. If the work is a mission, epic, or spans multiple tracker items, use
   `orchestrate`; the orchestrator may then assign subagents to other
   subskills.
4. If the work starts from a diff, use `review`. If it starts from a scenario or
   behavior claim, use `validate`.
5. If the user asks to set up agent-factory, use `install`.
6. If a tracker item intentionally permits breakage, closes out a migration, or
   asks for demolition/reconnect classification, use `migrate`.
