# Implement

Use this subskill for ordinary executable tracker items where the goal is to
change code, tests, or docs for one owned slice.

Do not use this subskill for graph planning, demolition, breaking migration,
terminal validation work, independent validation, or read-only review.

## Start Gate

Follow [repository workflow](../standards/repo-workflow.md) for git worktree
checks, and [tracker.md](../standards/tracker.md) plus `AGENTS.md` for
tracker mechanics and sync/check commands. Then verify the assigned item and
its mission or epic context:

```bash
atelier issue show <id>
atelier mission show <mission-id>
atelier mission status <mission-id>
```

Create or locate the mission worktree and start tracked work only when the item
is the work you are about to do:

```bash
atelier worktree for-mission <mission-id>
atelier start <id>
```

Use an extra issue worktree only when the assignment or repository binding
justifies isolation for contention, dirty state, high-risk work, or cross-epic
separation. Otherwise implement issue slices in the mission workspace and let
the repository-owned start command prepare the correct owner branch.

Do not scan the ready queue unless you are selecting work or coordinating the
graph. Full tracker lint is an orchestrator tracker-readiness check, not an
ordinary worker start gate.

## Scope Check

Before editing, verify:

- the item has no active blockers;
- the request matches the item scope;
- the package, app, workflow, file, or owned area is clear enough to start;
- Description, Outcome, Evidence, and Notes are discoverable when the tracker
  supports sectioned Markdown;
- the expected proof for the owned slice is clear;
- whether the proof can be issue-local or requires first-class evidence and
  independent validation or review;
- whether the issue belongs to a code-changing epic or standalone branch that
  requires a PR-equivalent review artifact, and where that artifact is linked;
- the parent epic validation criterion advanced by the slice is clear, when
  applicable;
- the item is linked to the assigned mission or epic graph, or the prompt
  explains why this worker is operating outside an active mission;
- the item is not really demolition, terminal validation, validation, review, or graph
  management work.

If the item is unclear, inspect only enough parent epic, sibling item, ADR, or
doc context to name the ambiguity. Do not reshape the graph unless explicitly
assigned planning work.

## Implementation Rules

- Update mapped docs before or alongside code when changing ownership,
  contracts, runtime flow, architecture, or user-visible behavior.
- During active rewrites, docs are the target design unless they are clearly
  stale, contradictory, or incomplete.
- Legacy compatibility is not preserved unless the assigned item explicitly
  makes compatibility the deliverable. Do not add shims, deprecated wrappers,
  compatibility symlinks, transitional aliases, dual paths, or old-path
  re-exports.
- Prefer one coherent owned slice over a narrow symptom patch.
- Bias toward test-driven development for behavior changes, bug fixes, contract
  changes, and non-trivial refactors.
- Skip tests only when the item is pure deletion, mechanical rename, docs-only,
  tracker-only, or the missing harness would add more noise than signal.

## Validation

Use the mapped validation router for check ownership. Run the narrowest checks
that prove the owned slice and satisfy the item's Outcome and Evidence. Do not
default to the whole suite unless the item asks for it.

Before marking work complete, record exact proof in the tracker. Include the
command names, relevant output lines, observed behavior, artifact paths, or
evidence IDs that prove each Outcome claim. Use first-class evidence when the
proof is more than a trivial note, a future worker must inspect it, or the item
is risky, broad, public-contract, process-policy, parent-level, epic, mission,
docs/help parity, stale-test, or migration work:

```bash
atelier evidence record --target issue/<id> --kind <kind> "summary"
atelier issue close <id> --reason "..."
```

Run raw workflow validators only when the repository binding, assignment, or
parent terminal contract explicitly requires an advanced policy check. A
workflow validator does not replace issue-local proof or attached evidence.

If a broader check fails because the repo is intentionally mid-migration,
record the command, concrete failure shape, and item expected to reconnect or
close it out.

## Review Artifact Use

For code-changing work under a review artifact, use the artifact for code
discussion: summarize the worker context for the diff, respond to reviewer
findings, and push follow-up commits that address review threads. Do not copy
routine proof transcripts, tracker gate output, or scenario validation logs into
the PR-equivalent workspace. Those belong in Atelier evidence or issue
activity, linked from the review artifact only when the reader needs the proof
to understand the diff or merge readiness.

## Tracker Hygiene

Create follow-up tracker items for bugs, missing validation, cleanup work,
artifact updates for unresolved choices, or newly discovered ordering
constraints. Keep the current item focused unless the user explicitly broadens
scope.

Do not use interactive tracker commands; see [tracker.md](../standards/tracker.md)
for command conventions.

## Handoff

Before stopping, leave concise handoff context using the orchestrator-required
schema:

```text
result:
issue ID:
subskill:
changed files:
evidence IDs:
commands run:
dirty state:
branch/commit:
blockers:
exact follow-up recommendation:
```

The handoff must point to tracker proof, not private chat context. Include
tracker item status, exact validation output or artifact proof captured before
close, evidence records or durable notes added, docs/code/test files changed,
advanced policy-check result if one was required, whether `atelier issue close <id>`
was run, parent epic validation criterion advanced when applicable, expected
failures, and follow-up tracker item IDs.

Follow [repository workflow](../standards/repo-workflow.md) for the handoff
git check, and [tracker.md](../standards/tracker.md) for syncing or exporting
tracker state.
