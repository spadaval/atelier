# Review

Use this subskill for independent code review. Code review starts from the diff and
judges whether the change is well-built. It is not scenario validation.

## Sources

Read the changed files and relevant:

- the mapped agent instructions;
- the mapped quality index;
- the mapped code standards when code policy matters;
- the mapped validation router when test or validation coverage is part of the
  review;
- docs, ADRs, tracker item Description, Outcome, Evidence, Notes, and expected
  migration breakage for the changed area.

## Review Stance

Reviewers are read-only by default. Do not edit files unless explicitly asked.
When a PR-equivalent review artifact exists, use it as the primary surface for
code review findings, inline comments, review decisions, and follow-up
discussion with the worker. Keep Atelier evidence for proof summaries,
transcripts, residual risk, and review records that must stand on their own
after the provider UI is unavailable.

Lead with findings ordered by severity. Focus on:

- behavioral bugs introduced by the change;
- architecture or ownership regressions;
- missing or misleading tests;
- security, data loss, persistence, concurrency, or lifecycle risk;
- compatibility shims, deprecated wrappers, or legacy paths;
- docs/code disagreement;
- vague, missing, or unprovable Outcome text on touched tracker work;
- missing Evidence, evidence that only names effort, or claims not backed by
  attached proof;
- stale, skipped, or ignored tests being used as proof without inspection;
- public help, command behavior, docs, or Agent Factory guidance drifting apart;
- validation claims unsupported by evidence.

If no issues are found, say that clearly and mention residual risk or unrun
checks.

## Evidence

Findings cite concrete files and lines when possible. Explain why the
issue matters and what to change. Do not bury findings under a long summary.

Use this output shape:

```text

- Severity: file:line - issue, impact, recommendation.

Open Questions

Reviewers may recommend validation, but they do not close product validation
unless separately assigned the `validate` subskill.
